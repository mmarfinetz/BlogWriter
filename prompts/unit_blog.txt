Write a blog post merging two pieces: 'Thought Process that Led to UNIT' and 'UNIT Expert Statement (2.2).' Eliminate overlap, like repeated critiques of fiat or gold. Skip the user story section from 'UNIT Expert Statement' it should read slightly as a manifesto, not a technical walkthrough. Start with a punchy analogy or question about the dollar's flaws, then dissect the problems with current monetary standards (fiat, gold, Bitcoin) using concise logic and data. Transition into UNIT as the solution, listing its core principles (non-expansionary, decentralized, stable) with sharp explanations. Use subheadings and a numbered list where it fits. End with a call-to-action or big-picture statement about UNIT's potential. Match this style: analytical but clear, technical yet human, with phrases like 'paradox,' 'strategic,' or 'empirically.' Avoid generic AI fluffâ€”make it sound like a person who's thought this through

Thought Process that Led to UNIT:
The Problem with the Dollar Standard
The US-led global expansionary monetary policy is the root cause of modern financial crises through subsidizing borrowers' over-investment activities. It also redistributes value from savers to borrowers without democratic consent. This global price fixing scheme of the value of major currencies subjugates the decentralized free market orders to centralized politics.
The Lack of Alternatives to the Dollar Standard
Wrapper Stablecoin, in the likes of USDC, USDT, or DAI-PSM, is parasitic upon fiat currencies and, as such, inherits their expansionary monetary policy.
Credit Stablecoin, in the likes of RAI, also subtly inherits the global expansionary monetary policy through the "negative interest rate" equilibrium. Simply put, the borrowers in the RAI system, can always choose to borrow in USD, not RAI, and as a result RAI's purchasing power must also depreciate over the long run in order to compete with the Dollar for borrowers.
Bitcoin, from a political angle, is the near-perfect alternative because of its politics-independent fixed supply monetary policy. However, from an economical angle, its high volatility makes it ineffective as a store of buying power or medium of exchange, both right now and likely at least in the next few decades.
Gold, from an economic angle, is the near-perfect alternative. It has successfully functioned as the global reserve currency since history, and even after being ruthlessly suppressed by world governments since WWII, has managed to preserve purchasing power. Empirically, the price of Gold has tracked the growth of USD M2 exceedingly well, basically canceling out the global expansionary monetary policy. However, from the political angle, its physical presence, and its associated UX, makes it necessary to store at banks with centralization risks. Confiscation of Gold by governments from its citizens was how our current credit money system was born.
Productive assets have never and likely will never serve as as a monetary standard because their valuation is made through discounted cashflow and not monetary consensus. Its valuation logic rarely survives the tail-risk events that money is exactly designed to withhold: when the world falls into chaos, you'd want to hold Gold or Bitcoin or the Dollar, and not stocks.

The UNIT Standard
In loose terms, any successor to the Dollar Standard must satisfy the following requirements:
It must not be expansionary, in order to beat the Dollar and its other parasitic forms.
It must be sufficiently decentralized, in order to beat Gold.
It must be sufficiently stable, in order to beat Bitcoin.

UNIT's strong claim is that the only possible way to satisfy all three criteria for a long duration is UNIT is designed to be this new commodity-money.
First of all, Ray Dalio phrases it simply:

Inflation
Inflation must be defined scientifically as the expansion of monetary supply given a constant level of monetary demand. It must not be defined in terms of the purchasing power of money because price is a result of chaotic interactions of subjective human valuations, and in the long run cannot be captured by statistics (immeasurability problem).
A main objective of Unit is to cancel out inflation, as defined properly. The problem with inflation is both political and economical. Politically, inflation is a way for government to levy taxes with-out democratic consent. Economically, inflation never acts uniformly nor all at once, it re-distributes wealth and income to those who first get their hands on the newly issued money, be it the issuer itself, the banks, or the entrepreneurs. And because the issuer, banks, and entrepreneurs nearly always prefer production goods over consumption goods, this process creates over-investments. Over-investments is the root cause of business cycles, one of the main evils of our times.
I still think that, without doubt, targeting M2 is the only scientific way to precisely achieve this objective.
Decentralization
When we went off Gold standard, Gold price tanked because it lost part of its monetary premium. However, it seems to have preserved most of its monetary premium in spite of massive concerted efforts from all governments to try to outlaw it - exactly like how they treat the threat of Bitcoin. It's absolutely extra-ordinary how resilient Gold's monetary premium is. I think that it is almost certain that Gold will regain more foothold for the next 30 years. Inflation works if and only if the public can be deceived, and the public is becoming more and more aware of the evils of inflation.
Would we go back to the Gold Standard? I think much more possibly than people who lack imagination would presume. It does perfectly solve the economical problem with inflation.
However, the Gold Standard cannot solve the political problem of inflation. As a physical object, its abhorrent UX prevents it from being directly used and custodian'ed in 21st century global and digital commerce. It is fundamentally a currency that requires intermediaries in order to function. As such, the intermediaries will always present a threat to global commerce at the root level, and historically, especially in emergencies, Gold had always been mis-appropriated by these intermediaries.
A decentralized, digital version of Gold, when Gold is the common money standard, would be theoretically perfect.
Bitcoin's Volatility
When England went back onto the Gold Standard after the WWI at the pre-war parity, Gold price skyrocketed. This is the same problem Bitcoin. A sudden jolt to the supply or demand for money necessarily creates a violent move in the price of money. The economic effect of this is the same as inflation/deflation itself: because it doesn't act uniformly and simultaneously, it amounts to a re-distribution of wealth of income: those who had gold/bitcoin early would benefit massively from this change of monetary standard. This is the root cause of Bitcoin's volatility, and Bitcoin volatility is too much. The Bitcoin commerce community is under constant threat of involuntary wealth and income redistribution: this is much worse than the dollar, and so commerce cannot be based on this level of volatility.
Stability
The supply of money is certain and measurable: fiat supply depends on central banking monetary policy and regulated banking activities, Gold supply depends on gold ming, Bitcoin supply depends on its own monetary policy. In the case of Gold and Bitcoin, the supply side is predictable. In the of fiat, the supply side is less predictable, but still easy to see.
The demand for money is the aggregate of individuals' demand for money. Because an individual demand for anything is subjective, it is never predictable nor measurable in exactness. Statistics helps because they will never escape the low signal-to-noise and overfitting problems, and useless in the long run in the face of actual, black-swan uncertainties.
Practically speaking, the demand for money is the commerce community's aggregate willingness to hold. Every unit of money is held by someone, doing nothing. It may change hands quickly, but the receiver the transaction will become the new holder of the currency and so on. So roughly speaking, the stability of the demand for money is mainly determined by stability of the commerce community.
The UNIT Standard
UNIT must satisfy all of the above criteria in order to become a new and better monetary standard for a sizable commerce community:
It must not inflate, in order to beat Fiat.
It must be decentralized, in order to beat Gold.
It must be stable, in order to beat Bitcoin.

Bounding Phase
UNIT v2's bounding phases sacrifices part of 2 in order to satisfy 1 + 3. It is essentially a money-substitute for a non-inflating version of the Dollar. It operates like private money issued by a bank.
Final Phase
The distinguishing mark of the final phase is complete decentralization, 2 to the max.
1 is easy to preserve, simply fixed supply.
3 will only be achieved if the commerce community that it serves is stable. This is a market condition, not something that can be engineered. My best guess is that this condition will be achieved when the Defi commerce community will have grown to its limit and then remain stabilized. This is the theoretically best trigger condition for Unit to start entering its final phase.
Defi
The economy produces consumption goods as dividends. Production goods are goods that can be turned into consumptions goods in the future. Production goods' valuation is, in the final, determined by the total value of consumption goods that it can produce.
At the limit, Defi can become the world's market for production goods.
Consumptions goods are physical and widespread, and as such, they will tend to remain in firm grasps of fiat currencies. In the best scenario, we will have the following route: UNIT -> Dollar to spend on consumption goods -> seller of the goods convert the Dollar that they received back into Unit. But it is never going to be realistic for consumption goods to ever be quoted in Unit. Governments will never allow this.
Production goods, however, are meaningfully virtual. IP, human capital, etc. a lot of it is by nature virtual, and in the future can very much be on-chain. For the other production goods, RWA and synthetic assets are critical. It is entirely possible to quote and trade these virtual assets in UNIT. The best possible scenario is for the Defi commerce community to hold Unit as money -> swap UNIT for SPY -> the seller of SPY still holds UNIT. Note that this process need not involve the Dollar in any way.
Once the Defi commerce community stabilizes: anybody who will manage their finances through Defi will have already done so. The major aggregate metrics grow or lose single digits percentage every year. And if this commerce community has adopted the final version of UNIT as money, then UNIT will also be finally stable.
UNIT Expert Statement (2.2)
UNIT Expert Statement (2.2)
UNIT in 1 Paragraph
UNIT is a maximally decentralized, sufficiently stable cryptocurrency. Its objective is to provide a viable alternative to expansionary fiat currencies in the coming decades.
UNIT Principles
UNIT holds itself to the principle of credible neutrality invented by Bitcoin and developed by Ethereum's VB. It has no pre-mine, team, or any other insider tokens: anyone that wants it has to get it like everyone else. It starts with an oracle with minimal governance and later programmatically shuts down both the oracle and the governance.
UNIT considers Gold to be a sufficiently stable store of value. Gold's scarcity and global acceptability allows it to sufficiently maintain buying power since recorded history. In particular, in the last 100 years, despite fierce government suppression, Gold price has tracked US Dollar M2 supply. This means that it has counteracted dollar's expansionary monetary policy and retained buying power.
UNIT assumes that ETH, despite its excess volatility, will greatly appreciate in value over the next decades. It only uses staked ETH as its collateral.
UNIT must aggressively grow its acceptance as a currency. In order to grow into a common medium of exchange first for Defi then for other economies, it has adopted Bitcoin's growth program of heavily rewarding early adopters with venture upside in excess of its monetary store. UNIT values accessibility and community. It uses the simplest possible mechanism and constant values where feasible. It has a lean core and expects a fat ecosystem. The initial developers enjoy no privileges and are vested volunteers like all future developers and community leaders. Community work does not benefit any privileged group, and conversely, without community work, there will be no work done.
